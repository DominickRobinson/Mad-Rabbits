Then why are you helping us?” asks Sarge. “You seem misguided, blue one. Not all bears are bad. In fact, most bears are just fine. We have always been fine. We are simply the result of the environment in which we were raised,” explains Karen. She continues, “I have sought you out because you are the only ones to have challenged Winnie face-to-face. You can change this.” Karen chuckles, “And besides, my retirement days have been quite boring. I could use some action.”"

Why can’t we be their friends?” Rex replies, “They are trying to steal all of the carrots in Happy Land to forge an ultimate weapon, the Infinity Carrot, which will grant its wielder an untold power, enough to conquer Happy Land.” Sarge responds, “Wow, that sounds scary!” Rex, “Yes, it is. That is why we cannot lose…” BANG!!! As if on cue, Rex and Sarge hear an explosion in the distance. “The village is under attack!” yells Rex. They race back to the village."
