Sarge is confused, but Ninja immediately lunges and attacks, crying out, “A NINJA BUNNY NEVER LOSES TO A BEAR! HIYA!” Fortunately for the bear, Chip jumps in front of her and uses his ability to expand, protecting her. “HEY NOW, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! LET ME AT HER!” screams Ninja. “Where are we? What happened?” asks Sarge. “You see, young rabbits. You have been frozen for 6900 years. Your legendary fight against Winnie has been passed down for generations. Unfortunately, he is still in power. That is why I came searching for you,” explained Karen. “I’m not a rabbit, I am a bunny. A b-u-n-n-y… ugh,” grumbled Ninja. "

Why can’t we be their friends?” Rex replies, “They are trying to steal all of the carrots in Happy Land to forge an ultimate weapon, the Infinity Carrot, which will grant its wielder an untold power, enough to conquer Happy Land.” Sarge responds, “Wow, that sounds scary!” Rex, “Yes, it is. That is why we cannot lose…” BANG!!! As if on cue, Rex and Sarge hear an explosion in the distance. “The village is under attack!” yells Rex. They race back to the village."
