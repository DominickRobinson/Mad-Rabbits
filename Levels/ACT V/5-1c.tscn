The gang steps out of the beam and Sarge is surprised. “I’m home. I can’t believe it’s still here.” Sarge’s old village has long been deserted but it remains familiar to him. Soon, rabbits and bears from across the land pour into the village, having followed the beam of light. They surround the gang. Sarge climbs to the top of a burnt hut and proclaims, “Everyone, everyone. You are all free now. Neither Winnie nor Rex are here now. Tyranny rules this land no longer. We must rebuild. Together! For Chip!” The crowd is silent, but they suddenly erupt, “FOR CHIP! FOR CHIP!” They cheer and celebrate. Slowly, over the next 69 years, all of Happy Land’s inhabitants rebuild the land and live in harmony. "

I am in no shape to fight anymore. We lost. You must avenge our village and all of rabbit-kind. Show those evil bears that they can’t mess with us rabbits and get away with it. Do it… for us. Do it… for me.” Rex passes out, and Sarge cries. “NOOOOOO, CHIEF!!!” He looks down and closes his eyes, then reopens them with vigor and determination. “I must avenge my village. I must avenge Chief Rex.” And thus, this now Mad Rabbit embarks on an Epic Vegetable Quest."
